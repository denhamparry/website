## Getting started

### Security

#### Enable 2FA

2 Factor Authentication (2FA) is when a username, password and one time password are required to confirm authentication.

TODO: Add 2FA setup

### Remote connection

#### Setup DDNS

1) Connected onto DSM with local IP address
) Control Panel > External Access > DDNS > Add
  ) Service Provider - Synology
  ) Hostname - Unique hostname to use as subdomain of [https://synology.me]()
  ) Email - Your email address linked to the synology account
  ) Heartbeat - Enable
    ) Will receive notifications if the connection is down
  ) External Address - The external IPs of the network

#### Port Forwarding

1) Enable port forwarding on your router for:
  ) 5000,5001 (TCP)
  ) 80,443 (TCP/UDP)

#### Test

1) Go to [https://account.synology.com/]() and confirm that the device is visable
) Attempt to connect via [https://your-hostname.synology.me]()

### Custom DNS

#### Enable custom domain

1) Control Panel > Network > DSM Settings > Domain
  ) Enable customized domain - [x]
  ) Add custom domain
    ) Update DNS to use [https://your-hostname.synology.me]() as your CNAME

#### Generate Certificate

1) Control Panel > Security > Certificate > Add
  ) Add a new certificate
  ) Get a certificate from Let's Encrypt
    ) Set as default certificate - [x]
  ) Get a Certificate from Let's Encrypt
    ) Domain name - [https://your-hostname.synology.me]()
    ) Email - Your email address
    ) Subject Alternative Name - any other sub-domains
