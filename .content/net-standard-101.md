> .net Standard is a contract that allows an API to be Standard compliant.  Its not a downloadable package.

> If you want to support more platforms, aim for a low .net Standard version number to support more frameworks.

> dotnet Core issues included the API not being familiar to dotnet developers, which is what Core 2.0 aims for.
