From researching Time Management techniques, a recommendation of using mantras to help make decisions quickly has been suggested a number of times.

The thought process is that there shouldn't be much of a thought process at all.  For example, going out for lunch and someone says "Would you like Cake?", I would use my "Yes when cake" mantra to tell me to eat said cake without question.

In reality, this should allow focus to be maintained on critical tasks improving said time management.  These are the selection that I've created and testing out.

To note, I'm looking at a way to maintain these within a digital journal rather than paper based.

> I'd rather be a hypocrite than the same person forever

- Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz from Beasite Boys said this when questioned about his opinions on Women when referenced to lyrics to previous songs
- Times change and we learn, times change and we address past inequalities
- Do what you believe is right now
- If it changes address it in the future.

> If I have to do it everyday, do it early

- Instead of pushing tasks back and keeping them on the mind, build them into a morning routine
- Get them done rather than worrying about what you have to do later on

> If you're learning, listen, record, then process

- To often I find myself losing distraction when in meetings or learning from others
- Type along with what you're learning

> Conserve your brain power for whats important

- Stop worrying about the things that don't matter

> Sooner is better than late

- There may never be a tomorrow so do it now

> Trust the process

- Following a process brings routine, even to chaos
- Build a process that can build trust and expected results

> When in doubt, throw it out

- Don't waste time, space, or engery on things you don't need

> Delegate it / Record it / Do it

- If someone else can do it, delegate it to them and add a record, if required, to check in
- If it takes you out of your flow, record it and review the task at a later time
- If you can do it in your flow, and it won't impact anything else, do it

> Measure twice, cut once

- Even with digital tasks, focus on time being the unit of value that we don't want to waste

> Make a backup before changing

- You can always go back

> If all else fails, read the manual

- Googling gets you so far, Stackoverflow with someone elses voted answer is their opinion
- Read the manual and decide for yourself

> When debugging, change one thing at a time

Don't fix what isn't broken and limit the blast radius of what can change the output

> Always test your work

Test now rather than fix later

> You're not done until someone else tests it too

The person that you're fixing the issue for ultimatly is the person who confirms if it is done

> What do people want to know

When on a call, what do people really want to know?

> Explain How

Don't explain what it is or what it does, explain how it works

> Focus / Focus / Focus

Just focus
