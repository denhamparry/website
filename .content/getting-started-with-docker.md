Being an IT contractor, I usually find myself setting up a clients environment to get their project to work locally.  As these are setup by individuals, there is a lack of common practice to be able to get setup quickly and end up having to put the hot fixes in place that have been in place for years.

Initially I looked towards Docker as a way to create identical environments between Windows and Mac.  Once I understood the core concept of Docker I realised how useful it could be in any project.

Once the Docker configuration for a project is setup, a new user could have a local container setup, ready to go from 2 command lines.

Below is my first attempt at creating a Docker configuration for a simple Angular project.

# Docker

## Layered File System

* Docker is like a cake with multiple layers
* Writable file layer within container can be lost

## Volumes

* A directory associated to the container.
* Know as **data volume**
* These are persistent
* Alias to folder in docker host

#### docker-machine

```terminal
docker-machine ls
docker-machine start [machine-name]
docker-machine stop [machine-name]
docker-machine env [machine-name]
docker-machine ip [machine-name]
docker-machine status [machine-name]
```

### images

```terminal
docker pull [image-name]
docker images
docker rmi [image-id]
```

### container

```terminal
docker run [image-name]
docker ps -a
docker rm [container-id]
docker rm -v [container-id]
```

<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>-v</strong></td>
<td>Remove volume associated with container</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### volume

```terminal
docker run -p 8080:3000 -v /var/www/ node
docker inspect [container-name]
docker run -p 8080:3000 -v $(pwd):/var/www/ node
docker run -p 8080:3000 -v $(pwd):/var/www/ node
docker run -p 8080:3000 -v $(pwd):/var/www/ -w "/var/www/" node npm start
docker run -i -t -p 8080:500 -v $(pwd):/app -w "/app" microsoft/aspnet:1.0.0-rc1-update1-coreclr /bin/bash
```
