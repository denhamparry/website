> The best way to start after quite a break...

Since the last blog post, my career has gone from here to there, down to up (x999), and everywhere in-between.
Personally I've learned a lot, and as to be expected these lessons aren't limited to technology.
One of the things I've learnt is to reduce pressure on myself.  So for that, this isn't a new beginning and the previous posts are not the end.
The beauty of moving forward is looking back, and looking back can help direct where you want to go next.

## Things I wish I knew

Looking back, these are the challenges that I had and looked to resolve.  I'll look to write posts regarding each of these to help others avoid the pitfalls that I found.

### Leaving DotNet for Cloud Native

### Training

- From attending training sessions to supporting them and eventually leading them
- Tips and tricks for attending workshops to get the most out of them
- Tips and tricks to presenting a workshops, whether its at work during lunch, meetup, conference, or paid for private workshop 
- Best ways to learn

- How to close a company, is it as easy as I hoped it would be

### From Windows to MacOS (with Windows via Parallel) to MacOS to Windows 10 to Windows 10 WSL2 to Linux

- Migrating from OS to OS and never stopping never stopping
- Is the investment in an OS lost time or is there opportunity moving from one to another

### Dotfiles

- From the aspect of OS and learning to love chaos, `dotfiles` allow to spin up a new machine that feels like home
- How this is available to any OS
- Tips and lessons learned

### Loving the terminal

- Used to see a terminal as a reference to 80's movies
- Coming from a Visual Studio background, I attached heavy to GUI
- Learned to love the terminal
- Feel that GUI and Dashboards might be coming full circle

### Containers and Orchestrators

- This is the bet I took and utimatly paid off for me
- The fasted *tl;dr* for getting up to speed with:
  - containers
  - kubernetes

### People in technology

- Lots of focus is on being technical, sharing code or is this just flexing code?
- I feel the investment in people is key to the future
- How do we invest in others, how do we build trust in others

### Day to Day workflow

- Lived a life on a train for over a year and had to adapt workflow
- Working remotely, not in a home office
- Migrating to working remotely in a home office
- How to manage work with family life

There is more to add and I'll push changes using this more as a journal than a blog platform.
